Generates an Automated PDF report summarizing recommendations and input rationale.\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","## üìå How to Use This Notebook\n","\n","### üîß Step 1: Install Required Libraries\n","The notebook will automatically install Gradio and import all required dependencies.\n","\n","### üìÇ Step 2: Upload the Trained Model\n","Upload the pretrained model file named `rf_adc_pipeline.pkl` when prompted.  \n","> üí° Make sure this file was exported using `joblib` from a compatible Python environment.\n","\n","### üß™ Step 3: Enter Input Parameters\n","Once the interface loads, you‚Äôll be able to enter values for the following properties of your ADC:\n","\n","### üìä Feature Definitions & Their Role in Platform Selection\n","\n","Below is a short explanation of each input feature and how it relates to ADC conjugation platform recommendations:\n","\n","### üß¨ Technology_Category (0‚Äì2)\n","Represents the high-level conjugation technology class (e.g., traditional, site-specific, or novel chemistry). This influences compatibility with payloads, scalability, and clinical maturity.\n","\n","### ‚öñÔ∏è DAR_Mean (Drug-to-Antibody Ratio - Mean)\n","The average number of drug molecules attached per antibody. Optimal DAR impacts potency, toxicity, and platform suitability (some platforms only tolerate certain DAR ranges).\n","\n","### üìà DAR_Std / DAR_CV (Standard Deviation / Coefficient of Variation)\n","Measures of DAR heterogeneity. Lower variability generally suggests better control and product consistency, which is preferred in regulatory and manufacturing contexts.\n","\n","### üîê Stability_Score\n","Represents the biochemical and storage stability of the ADC (0‚Äì10). Unstable conjugates may require specific linker chemistries or more robust platforms.\n","\n","### üß™ Expression_Ease (0.0‚Äì1.0)\n","Indicates how easily the antibody or engineered site can be expressed and produced. Higher ease favors platforms requiring genetic modifications or engineered sites.\n","\n","### üß¨ Homogeneity (0.0‚Äì1.0)\n","Assesses structural uniformity of the final ADC product. Homogeneous products are more favorable in clinical and regulatory settings and often associated with advanced conjugation platforms.\n","\n","### üí∞ Cost_Index (0.0‚Äì1.0)\n","Normalized estimate of platform-associated cost. Lower-cost platforms may be prioritized for early-stage programs or when budget is a key constraint.\n","\n","### ‚ö†Ô∏è CMC_Risk (0 = Low, 1 = Medium, 2 = High)\n","Represents the estimated Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) risk. Higher risk may limit platform selection to more established technologies with proven scalability and quality profiles.\n","\n","### ‚úÖ Approved_Usage (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\n","Indicates whether the platform has already been used in approved ADC products. Regulatory precedent increases confidence and may influence platform selection for faster approval timelines.\n","\n","### üè¢ Vendor (0, 1, 2)\n","Encodes the platform provider (e.g., CDMO or internal tech stack). Vendor choice can affect technical compatibility, support availability, and strategic alignment.\n","\n","### üìà Scalability (0.0‚Äì1.0)\n","Represents how easily the platform can be scaled up for manufacturing. Crucial for late-stage or commercial ADC programs.\n","\n","### ‚è±Ô∏è Latency_to_Clinic_yrs\n","Estimated time (in years) to bring a candidate using this platform into clinical trials. Influences decision-making in fast-track or competitive pipeline strategies.\n","\n","---\n","\n","Each of these features plays a role in how suitable or viable a given conjugation platform is for your ADC candidate, considering both scientific and development constraints.\n","\n","\n","Use the sliders, dropdowns, and radio buttons to set these parameters.\n","\n","### üöÄ Step 4: View Recommendation\n","After you enter the values, the model will output a **recommended conjugation platform** such as:\n","\n","> ‚úÖ Recommended ADC Conjugation Platform: **Lysine-Based**\n","\n","### üöÄ Step 4: Receive Prediction & Download Report\n","\n","- The model will output the **recommended ADC conjugation platform** (e.g., ‚ÄúEngineered Cys‚Äù or ‚ÄúLysine-Based‚Äù).\n","- A professional PDF will be generated summarizing the recommendation.\n","- Run the final cell to download the report:\n","  \n","```python\n","from google.colab import files\n","files.download(\"adc_platform_report.pdf\")\n","```\n","---\n","\n","## üõ†Ô∏è Notes\n","- If you encounter an error, make sure all inputs are filled in and the correct model file is uploaded.\n","- This model was trained on historical ADC development data and is meant for research and educational purposes only.\n","\n","---\n","\n","Let‚Äôs get started! üëá\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-XiTB13UlyZa"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install gradio fpdf --quiet\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","import joblib\n","import gradio as gr\n","from fpdf import FPDF\n","from google.colab import files\n","import datetime\n","\n","# Upload model\n","print(\"üì§ Please upload 'rf_adc_pipeline.pkl'\")\n","uploaded = files.upload()\n","model_pipeline = joblib.load('rf_adc_pipeline.pkl')\n","\n","# Prediction + PDF generation\n","def predict_and_report(tech_cat, dar_mean, dar_std, dar_cv,\n","                       stability, expression, homogeneity,\n","                       cost, cmc_risk, usage, vendor,\n","                       scalability, latency):\n","\n","    try:\n","        input_dict = {\n","            'Technology_Category': tech_cat,\n","            'DAR_Mean': float(dar_mean),\n","            'DAR_Std': float(dar_std),\n","            'DAR_CV': float(dar_cv),\n","            'Stability_Score': float(stability),\n","            'Expression_Ease': float(expression),\n","            'Homogeneity': float(homogeneity),\n","            'Cost_Index': float(cost),\n","            'CMC_Risk': cmc_risk,\n","            'Approved_Usage': usage,\n","            'Vendor': vendor,\n","            'Scalability': float(scalability),\n","            'Latency_to_Clinic_yrs': float(latency)\n","        }\n","\n","        X_new = pd.DataFrame([input_dict])\n","        for col in ['Technology_Category', 'CMC_Risk', 'Approved_Usage', 'Vendor']:\n","            X_new[col] = X_new[col].astype(str)\n","\n","        pred = model_pipeline.predict(X_new)[0]\n","\n","        # PDF report generation\n","        pdf = FPDF()\n","        pdf.add_page()\n","        pdf.set_font(\"Arial\", 'B', 16)\n","        pdf.cell(200, 10, txt=\"ADC Conjugation Platform Report\", ln=True, align='C')\n","\n","        pdf.set_font(\"Arial\", size=12)\n","        pdf.ln(10)\n","        pdf.cell(200, 10, txt=f\"Generated on: {datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}\", ln=True)\n","\n","        pdf.set_font(\"Arial\", 'B', 14)\n","        pdf.set_text_color(0, 0, 128)\n","        pdf.ln(10)\n","        pdf.cell(200, 10, txt=\"Input Parameters:\", ln=True)\n","        pdf.set_font(\"Arial\", size=12)\n","        pdf.set_text_color(0, 0, 0)\n","        for key, val in input_dict.items():\n","            pdf.cell(200, 8, txt=f\"{key}: {val}\", ln=True)\n","\n","        pdf.set_font(\"Arial\", 'B', 14)\n","        pdf.set_text_color(0, 100, 0)\n","        pdf.ln(10)\n","        pdf.cell(200, 10, txt=f\"Recommended Platform: {pred}\", ln=True)\n","\n","        pdf.output(\"adc_platform_report.pdf\")\n","\n","        return f\"Recommended Platform: {pred}\\nüìÑ PDF report generated successfully.
