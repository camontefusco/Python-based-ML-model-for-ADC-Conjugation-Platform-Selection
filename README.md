# ðŸ§ª Python-Based ML Model for ADC Conjugation Platform Selection

_A data-driven framework to evaluate antibody-drug conjugation (ADC) technologies using Python and machine learning._

A curated guide and decision-support tool to aid scientists in selecting optimal conjugation strategies for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), including summaries of current technologies, platform comparisons, and use-case recommendations.

# ADC Conjugation Technology Evaluation

## Overview

This project evaluates Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) conjugation technologies using synthetic and real-world datasets. The goal is to explore, analyze, and model ADC conjugation platforms to support informed technology selection and recommendation for ADC development.

## About This Project

### Goal

- Explore and interpret ADC conjugation technology data  
- Understand key attributes like Drug-to-Antibody Ratio (DAR), stability, homogeneity, manufacturability, and cost  
- Train predictive models to recommend the optimal conjugation platform for an ADC candidate  
- Provide a user-friendly tool with automated PDF reports for decision support  

### Dataset Highlights

- Includes multiple conjugation platforms: Random, Site-Specific Non-Selective, and Site-Specific Selective  
- Metrics cover DAR mean, DAR coefficient of variation, stability scores, homogeneity, expression ease, cost, manufacturability (scalability), and CMC risk  
- Data simulates batch variations and is inspired by public ADC developer platforms (WuXi Biologics, Genentech, Seagen, etc.) and scientific literature (Antibody Therapeutics 2025)

## Reports

- **adc_data_report.pdf**  
  Generated by running `synthetic_data_generator.ipynb`. This report provides detailed exploratory analysis and validation of the synthetic ADC conjugation dataset, including correlation heatmaps, boxplots, violin plots, and interactive visualizations.

- **adc_platform_report.pdf**  
  Generated by running `03_platform_recommender.ipynb`. This report is an automated PDF summary of the recommended ADC conjugation platform for a given candidate, based on the pretrained ML model and input parameters.

## Usage

### 1. Data Exploration

Run `01_data_exploration.ipynb` to:

- Load and validate the dataset  
- Generate correlation heatmaps, boxplots, violin plots  
- Visualize DAR mean vs. homogeneity with interactive Plotly scatterplots  
- Generate an automated HTML and PDF report summarizing data insights  

### 2. Model Training & Selection

Use `02_model_selection.ipynb` to:

- Preprocess features and labels  
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- Save the best performing model (`rf_adc_pipeline.pkl`)  

### 3. Platform Recommendation

Launch `03_platform_recommender.ipynb` for:

- An interactive Gradio app that takes input parameters of ADC candidates  
- Predicts the optimal conjugation platform using the pretrained model  
- Generates and downloads the `adc_platform_report.pdf` detailing the recommendation and rationale  

### 4. Generate & Validate Synthetic Data

Run `synthetic_data_generator.ipynb` to:

- Generate the synthetic ADC conjugation dataset (`adc_conjugation_synthetic_advanced.csv`)  
- Validate dataset assumptions and notebook workflows  
- Produce the comprehensive exploratory report `adc_data_report.pdf`
